## By the Way
- Everything is strings, all of the time, always... for now. The input? Strings. The keys? Strings. The values? Strings. *Literally everything is a string.* I'll generalize later.

## To Do
1. sbt doesn't allow backspaces in the terminal? Probably should write a proper client....
2. Space the client printouts properly.
3. Show message on server terminal window when a key is deleted.
4. Show message on server terminal window when a key is changed.
5. Show message in controller terminal window when a KVP is sent to a certain server.
6. The status message doesn't have proper ranges (i.e. (-∞, ∞)).
	- What are the max and min possible hash values generated by MurmurHash 3?
2. Fix concurrency issues for the controller/servers.
3. Fault tolerance!
