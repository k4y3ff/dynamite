## By the Way
- Everything is strings, all of the time, always... for now. The input? Strings. The keys? Strings. The values? Strings. *Literally everything is a string.* I'll generalize later.
- Don't type in dollar signs right now, because they're used as delimiters, and things will *totally* break.

## To Do
1. Fix key migration.
	1. Write coodinator to use the migration function on the server.
2. Write replicant servers.
