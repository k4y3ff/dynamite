## By the Way
- Everything is strings, all of the time, always... for now. The input? Strings. The keys? Strings. The values? Strings. *Literally everything is a string.* I'll generalize later.

## To Do
1. sbt doesn't allow backspaces in the terminal? Probably should write a proper client....
2. Add error message so that if a user tries to set the value for a key that already exists, it will prompt the user to update, instead.
3. Add an update command.
4. Space the client printouts properly.
5. Show message on server terminal window when a key is deleted.
6. Show message on server terminal window when a key is changed.
7. Show message in controller terminal window when a KVP is sent to a certain server.
8. The status message doesn't have proper ranges (i.e. (-∞, ∞)).
	- What are the max and min possible hash values generated by MurmurHash 3?
9. Fix concurrency issues for the controller/servers.
10. Fault tolerance!
