## By the Way
- Everything is strings, all of the time, always... for now. The input? Strings. The keys? Strings. The values? Strings. *Literally everything is a string.* I'll generalize later.

## To Do
1. User-proof the controller, in case of incomplete commands.
	- sbt doesn't allow backspaces in the terminal? Probably should write a proper client....
2. Fix concurrency issues for the controller/servers.
3. Fault tolerance!
